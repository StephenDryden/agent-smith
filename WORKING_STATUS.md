# Agent Smith â€“ Current Working Status (as of 2025-09-07)

## What Works

- **Docker Compose setup:**
  - Port mapping for all agents is correct (`8081:8080` for slite, `8083:8080` for commander).
  - Configuration files are mounted correctly.

- **Agent Commander endpoints:**
  - `/tools` endpoint: Returns live tools from connected agents (when commander is healthy and endpoints are registered).
  - `/healthz` endpoint: Returns health status of commander and connected agents.
  - `/agents` endpoint: Returns static agent info from config.

- **Agent Commander minimal API setup:**
  - Minimal API endpoints are mapped and should work if `app.UseRouting()` is called before mapping endpoints and `app.Run()`.
  - No controller classes are present, so `AddControllers()` and `MapControllers()` are not needed.

- **Port mapping:**
  - Commander is accessible on `localhost:8083` (host) mapped to `8080` (container).

## What Doesn't Work / Issues

- **/v1/chat endpoint:**
  - Currently returns "Empty reply from server" or 404.
  - Likely cause: Endpoint not registered, runtime error, or port mapping issue.
  - No `[CHAT]` logs seen in commander logs, indicating handler may not be reached.

- **/tools endpoint (recently):**
  - If broken, likely due to endpoint registration or app not restarted after code change.

- **New Relic agent:**
  - Disabled/commented out in compose and config.

## Troubleshooting Steps Taken

- Verified port mapping in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Removed controller setup to use minimal APIs only.
- Added detailed logging to `/v1/chat` handler.
- Restarted commander after code changes.
- Checked logs for `[CHAT]` output and endpoint registration issues.

## Next Steps / TODO

- Confirm commander endpoints are registered and healthy after every code change.
- If endpoints break, check for missing `app.UseRouting()` or endpoint mapping order.
- If `/v1/chat` still fails, exec into container and test on port 8080 directly.
- Add a diagnostic endpoint (e.g., `/ping`) if needed to confirm app is running.
- Document any new issues or fixes here for future reference.
